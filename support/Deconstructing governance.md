# Interoperable Adhocracy

_This is a live document, I'll appreciate any idea on how it could be improved_

##Deconsturcting governance
As part of the Uumm project I wanted to distill 'governance' to its bare bones, to later put it together in some sort of tool. It was personal exercice I wanted to do to understand the theortical and empirical issues.

It soon become aparent that 'governance' is a wide concept and very loosley used. What I really was trying to understand was Adhocracy.


### Meritocracy as a base.
All governance models are a supset of Meritocracy, if you understand _merit_ as the feature that defines the right of an entitity opinion to be considered (vote).

For a system to work, the defniniton of merit needs to create incentives towards the system goals. Merit should tell what is of value to the system in order to make decisions. If is defined broadly or incorrectly the system is likely to have [unintended consequences](http://lesswrong.com/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/) or be gammed.

In Bitcoin, to change the protocol (vote), the miner needs to secure the network (merit)

In a small business the right to make decisions (vote) belongs to the owner (merit)

### Merit is not a currency
`Merit can't be a medium of exchange`

If you can trade the merit you end up with a system ruled by the entities that have more economic power.

It does makes sense, of course, to reward the entities based on its merit. Or ideally based on a decision proven to be correct. 

####Reputation
Reputation systems have a very close correlation to merit. You could define reputation as a proven capcity of an entity. 

####Prediction markets
####Tokens


### Clear and simple goal
It is required for merit to be defined accurately



### Clear and simple goal
It is required for merit to be defined accurately

### Identity agnostic
If the goal is to make the best decision possible, it should not matter where the ideas com from. Anyone/thing should be a potential participant, whatever it's a kid, an AI, a prediction market, another governance entity.

### Nestable
That means a governance system should be able to act as a participant entity to another governance system.

Governance models tend to complexity. By nesting a governance inside another the incentives towards simple clear goals are kept, while adding sofistication to the system as a whole.



###Friction less
###Voluntary
###Simple
###Enforcable or turstable



##What can we build
One of the things that facinated me about Bitcoin was the fact that something as complex as a currency could work without an authority, or laws, Not imposed, completley voluntary.


For the first iteration I went for a hands on approach on how to implement a very specific usecase I was dealing with few months ago. I called 'contribution-based governance', where...

**Contribution = Voting rights = Earnings**


any small companies have adopted the lean start-up model, which emphasizes early prototyping and pivoting rapidly to new business models as circumstances change.8 In all these settings, informed, decisive action matters more than formal authority or knowledge.
