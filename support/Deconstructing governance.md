# Interoperable Adhocracy

_This is a live document, Any ideas on how it can be improved will be highly appreciated_

##Reconstructing governance
In recent years a new paradigm around decentralization has emerged.
technologies such as [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) or [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) offer a new set of possibilities for re-designing most of the systems that drive our society.

_Governance_ has been echoing within the community for long time. And for good reason. **The abscence of a central authority seems to imply no-governance**. Whatever this is true or not governance issues have been all over the place.

As part of the [Uumm](https://xavivives.github.io/Uumm/#intro) project I wanted to distill _governance_, to later put it together in some sort of tool. It was personal exercice to better understand how the future of governance may look like.

It soon become aparent that _governance_ is a very broad concept and very loosley used. What I really was trying to understand was [Adhocracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocracy).

This document is an attempt to imagine and lay down the fundamental pieces on how future organization could be govern within this new paradigm.

# Meritocracy as a base.
All governance models are a supset of [Meritocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy), if you understand _merit_ as the feature that defines the right of an entitity opinion to be considered (vote).

### Merit properties

* Defines what's of value to the system in order to make decisions.
* **Can't** be a medium of exchange
* Needs to be quantifiable

The previous properties don't get along very well to each other.

## Merit is value

For a system to work, the defniniton of merit needs to be aligned with the system goals. It should tell what is of value to the system in order to make decisions.

If defined broadly or incorrectly the system is likely to have [unintended consequences](http://lesswrong.com/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/) or be gammed.





## Merit is not a currency

If you can trade the merit you end up with a system ruled by the entities that have more economic power.

It does makes sense, of course, to reward the entities based on its merit. Or ideally based on a decision proven to be correct. But this is not the same thing.

## Tokenized merit
This is not a desired feature but a limitation. In order to operate, we need merit in a quantifiable format. Some sort of none-exchangable token.


### Reputation
Reputation systems have a very close correlation to merit. You could define reputation as a proven capcity of an entity.

### Clear and simple goal
It is required for merit to be defined accurately



### Clear and simple goal
It is required for merit to be defined accurately

### Identity agnostic
If the goal is to make the best decision possible, it should not matter where the ideas com from. Anyone/thing should be a potential participant, whatever it's a kid, an AI, a prediction market, another governance entity.

### Nestable
That means a governance system should be able to act as a participant entity to another governance system.

Governance models tend to complexity. By nesting a governance inside another the incentives towards simple clear goals are kept, while adding sofistication to the system as a whole.



###Friction less
###Voluntary
###Simple
###Enforcable or turstable



##What can we build
In Bitcoin, to change the protocol (vote), the miner needs to secure the network (merit)

In a small business the right to make decisions (vote) belongs to the owner (merit)

In a nation state to vote on elections (vote) you need to be a citizen  (merit)


One of the things that facinated me about Bitcoin was the fact that something as complex as a currency could work without an authority, or laws, Not imposed, completley voluntary.


For the first iteration I went for a hands on approach on how to implement a very specific usecase I was dealing with few months ago. I called 'contribution-based governance', where...

**Contribution = Voting rights = Earnings**


any small companies have adopted the lean start-up model, which emphasizes early prototyping and pivoting rapidly to new business models as circumstances change.8 In all these settings, informed, decisive action matters more than formal authority or knowledge.
