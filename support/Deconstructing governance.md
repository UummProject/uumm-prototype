# Interoperabile Adhocracy


## The ideal governance
For "ideal" I mean the necessary features that a system needs to make the best decisions possible, for whatever the goal is.

### Meritocracy as a base.
All the governance models are a supset of Meritocracy, if you understand _merit_ as the feature that defines the right to vote.

For a meritocracy to work, the defniniton of merit needs to create incentives towards the system goals. It should tell what it gives value to. If is defined broadly or incorrectly the system is likely to [fail](http://lesswrong.com/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/) or be gammed.

### Merit is not a currency
In rerospective it seems so ovious, but it wasn't that clear before.

`Merit can't be a medium of exchange`

If you can trade the merit you end up with a system ruled by the entities that have more economic power.

### Clear and simple goal
It is required for merit to be defined accurately

### Identity agnostic
If the goal is to make the best decision possible, it should not matter where the ideas com from. Anyone/thing should be a potential participant, whatever it's a kid, an AI, a prediction market, another governance entity.

### Nestable
That means a governance system should be able to act as a participant entity to another governance system.

Governance models tend to complexity. By nesting a governance inside another the incentives towards simple clear goals are kept, while adding sofistication to the system as a whole.



### Interoperable
If it is nestable, it needs to to communicate with other governaces (parents or childs). That means that some sort of interoperability should exist.

###Friction less
###Voluntary
###Simple
###Enforcable or turstable
