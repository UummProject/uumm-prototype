# Examples
These examples are to show how current governance system fits on the described meritocracy
_The numbers (1,2,3) make reference to the described merit properties_


## Nation state elections
**Decisions to make:** Choose the representatives

**Participants:** Legal citizens

**Merit properties:**

1. The required merit is to be a citizen.
2. Merit is bound to your identity, therefore can't be exchanged
3. Merit is tokenized by using ID cards. Each ID card is one vote.

**Reality (undesired consequences):**

1. All the participants (whatever they have the right capacities to make good decisions or not) have the same decision power. There is no required skill to vote.
2. While the ID card can't be exchanged, the opinion of the participants can be easily manipulated by media (especially because they don't have the capacities to understand the problems (#1)) which is manipulated by lobbyist, which are the entities with more economic power. 
3. Id cards tokenize merit but not without compromising the other properties.

## Bitcoin
**Decisions to make:** Change the protocol rules

**Participants:** Miners

**Merit properties:**

1. The required merit is a proof that it recently secured the network by validating transactions.
2. POW can't be exchanged. It is also directly attached to the coinbase reward, disincentivizing any attempt.
3. How many times a miner has been the first to find the block hash within a defined amount of blocks.

**Reality (undesired consequences):**

1. Miners don't want network upgrades that don't maximize their profit. A brutal amount of electricity is used.
2. All good here.
3. All good here.

## A company department
**Decisions to make:** What features of a product should we focus, who to hire, how much to pay?

**Participants:** Head of the department

**Merit properties:**

1. Someone with expertise on the subject, with fidelity to the company.
2. The merit is being himself, can't be exchanged, can be influenced.
3. Role defined in its contract ( a consequence of the time working for the company, resume...)

**Reality (undesired consequences):**

All good here, probably because it is not in a trustless environment, and it is easy to adapt.
