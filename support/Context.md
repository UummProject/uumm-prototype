### Context
In recent years a new paradigm around decentralization has emerged.
technologies such as [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) or [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) offer a new set of possibilities for re-designing most of the systems that drive our society.

_Governance_ has been echoing within the community for long time. And for good reason. The abscence of a central authority seems to imply no-governance. Whatever this is true or not governance, issues have been all over the place.

### Motivations
As part of the [Uumm](https://xavivives.github.io/Uumm/#intro) project I wanted to distill _governance_, to later put it together in some sort of tool with full consideration of this new paradigm. It was personal exercice to better understand how the future of governance may look like.

This document is an attempt to imagine and lay down the fundamental pieces on how future organizations build ont top of this new paradigmn may look like.
