# Interoperable Adhocracy
In the previous document we suggested an improvment on how a single decision making process could be improved.

On this one we'll try to envision how a decentralized ecosystem may function as a whole.

### Why adhocracy?
_Governance_ is a broad concept very loosely used. The new decentralized paradigmn has a set of properties that are much better captured by adhocracy.

>[Adhocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocracy#Types_of_adhocracy) is characterized by an adaptive, creative and flexible integrative behavior based on **non-permanence**  and **spontaneity**. - Wikipedia


## Voluntary

If you go over adhocracy [characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocracy#Characteristics_of_adhocracy) you will realize that many of those are just the result of participation being voluntary, therefore the _non-permanence_ feature.

### Darwinian selection
Voluntary participation on a governance system serves as [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism) tool.

The reason this is important is because it becomes another governance process at the most fundamental level. It tells if a project should exist or not.

Decentralized projects are intrinsically open-source, therfore they also can adapt or transofrm by being forked.

## Identity agnostic

If the goal is to make the best decision possible, it should not matter where the ideas com from. Anyone/anything should be a potential participant, whatever it's a kid, an AI, a prediction market or another governance entity.

Is the merit's job to filter who can participate.


## Nestable governance
That means that a governance system should be able to act as a participant entity to another governance system.

### Keep it simple
Governance models tend to complexity. By nesting a governance inside another the goals of a single governance entity can be keep simpler and therefore making the required merits simpler as well.

This means that a governance entity would be used as merit agregator of its participants.

### But complex
This would allow the creation of hierachical structures, making the system as a whole complex, while keeping each entity simple.

This is common in most goverances already (departments of a company, states/counties), that's why I was surprized to not find any existing proposal within the decentralized paradigm.


### Interoperability


### Wisdown of the crowds
We never witness the outcomes of [The DAO] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)) governance. Probably [it was not aimed to succeed](https://forum.daohub.org/t/the-dao-are-we-taking-the-wisdom-of-the-crowd-too-far/1486/8) anyway to put the  [wisdom of the crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd) in practice.
