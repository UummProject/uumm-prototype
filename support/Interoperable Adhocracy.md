# Interoperable Adhocracy

Before we attempted to describe the ideal features that single governance should have.

What if any governance system could interact with any other governance? How this ecosystem should look like. What would it enable.

### Why adhocracy?
_Governance_ is a broad concept very loosely used. The new decentralized paradigmn has a set of properties that are much better captured by adhocracy.

>[Adhocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocracy#Types_of_adhocracy) is characterized by an adaptive, creative and flexible integrative behavior based on **non-permanence**  and **spontaneity**. - Wikipedia


## Voluntary

If you go over adhocracy [characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocracy#Characteristics_of_adhocracy) you will realize that many of those are just the result of participation being voluntary, therefore the _non-permanence_ feature.

### Darwinian selection
Voluntary participation on a governance system serves as [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism) tool.

The reason this is important is because it becomes another governance process at the most fundamental level. It tells if a project should exist or not.

Decentralized projects are intrinsically open-source, therfore they also can adapt or transofrm by being forked.


## Identity agnostic

If the goal is to make the best decision possible, it should not matter where the ideas com from. Anyone/anything should be a potential participant, whatever it's a kid, an AI, a prediction market or another governance entity.

Is the merit's job to filter who can participate.

### Zero knowledge proof reputation
There is a little paradox here. We need decentralized identities in order to build decentralized reputation systems.
We also want the governance tools to be identity agnostic. While I don't see this as showstopper, [Zero knoledge proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) reputation seems be a nice to have

Crypto-currencies almost come with this property built-in. The main problem here is accounts can be exchanged. [a](Reference required)

## Nestable governance
That means that a governance system should be able to act as a participant entity to another governance system.

### Keep it simple
Governance models tend to complexity. By nesting a governance inside another the goals of a single governance entity can be keep simpler and therefore making the required merits simpler as well.

This means that a governance entity would be used as merit agregator of its participants.

### But complex
This would allow the creation of hierachical structures, making the system as a whole complex, while keeping each entity simple.

This is common in most goverances already (departments of a company, states/counties), that's why I was surprized to not find any existing proposal within the decentralized paradigm.


### Interoperability
Few DAOs exist and so many others are being created. It seems a good time to start working on some sort of standard. An [ERC20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) for governance.

I haven't directly tackled this problem yet. Would love to hear proposals on how this interface may look like.

In a small business the right to make decisions (vote) belongs to the owner (merit)

In a nation state to vote on elections (vote) you need to be a citizen  (merit)
