# Reputation for governance

Since we can't directly tokenize them, we can use the past as an indicator of the future. We can quantify proven capacities, and use it as merit.

Within this context, merit defines a required capacity of an entity to make decisions, while reputation is a proven record of a capacity.

This makes reputation systems extremely suitable for governance.


### Concensus problem

In both cases we still need to have concensus over these metrics, at least among the participants.



### Centralized
There are thousands of reputation systems already in use (5 stars rating, credentials, comments, followers, likes...), the problem is that they usually live in mutable (therefore can be altered) permission-ed (therefore un-accessible) databases. And because they're owned by entities that monetize on them, they have no incentive to change. 

### Decentralized
The new paradigm is different, and there are already [so many reasons](https://medium.com/@2W/fixing-orwellian-reputation-systems-4d01d489dcb7) to move away from the centralized reputation.

Communities/platforms/DAOs that live on decentralized networks do not benefit by keeping all this data, it's quite the opposite. They enhance each other when the data is accessible.


## Towards merit as reputation
So, how do we get there?

### Decentralized identity
In order to create decentralized reputation we need decentralized identities. Luckily, with different aproaches, there are several endeveours on the works: [DID](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/), [UPort](https://www.uport.me/), [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/), [Keybase](https://keybase.io), [identifi](https://github.com/identifi/) (missing any?)

### Accessible reputation
While each governance is free to use any reputation metric it wants, a standaritzation would make things much accessible. In the same fashion that the [ERC20](http://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/) has enabled all sorts of new services and platforms. Having and standard for decentralized reputation will greatly benefit the community.

While there have been attempts to standardize reputation [in the past](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7071), this document  is only attempt of decentralized reputation I'm aware of:

[Decentralized Cooperation needs Decentralized Reputation](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/DecentralizedCooperationNeedsDecentralizedReputation.md) by [Noah Thorp](https://twitter.com/noahthorp) (2015)

### Subjective reputation
The previous assumes reputation systems to be objective. Meaning that at least the participants need to have consensus over the state of a reputation metric.
To my knowledge blockchains are the more suitable technology for it.

In general when we talk about reputation, we refer to subjective reputation. How do an entity _feels_ about something. Each entity may have a different opinon.

Subjective reputation may be very useful for decision making processes, but makes things harder to implement. I currently don't have an opinion on how this could be done.

 like [identifi](https://github.com/identifi/) and [Trust Graph](https://github.com/trustgraph/trustgraph) work on P2P basis.
