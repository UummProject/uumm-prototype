#Interoprable Adhocracy

In the last month. I've been working with Uumm. A contribution based governance tool built on Ethereum.
It was a great excuse to dig deeper into Ethereum, but I also wanted to use it as practical exercice to deconstruct governance.

It is more clear that ever the most important governance models driving our society are completly obsolete.

At the same time, new tools and paradigms have appear and sooner or later, in a more or less disruptive way they I'll replace them. Just time.

Here I'm refering as governance at the specific process to find concensus about a set of issues.

##The ideal governance
For "ideal" I mean the necessary features that a system needs to make the best decisions possible, for whatever the goal is.

###Meritocracy as a base.
All the governance models are a supset of Meritocracy, if you understand "merit" as the feature that defines the requirements of an entity to participate in the decision making. 

The definition of the merit is one is a key element. If is defined broadly the system will be gammed.

###Merit is not a currency
In retrospective it seems so ovious, but it wasn't that clear before. **Merit can't be a medium of exchange** If you can trade the merit you end up with a system ruled by the entities that have more economic power.

###Identity agnostic
If the goal is to make the best decision possible, it should not matter where the ideas com from. Anyone/thing should be a potential participant, whatever it's a kid, an AI, a prediction market, another governance entity.
The key, here is the merit to be well defined.

###Voluntary
If the participation is imposed, the governance looses the main indicator

###Nestable
Governance models tend to complexity. A lot of decisions 

###Interoperable


###Friction less
The more accessible/fast/

###Enforcable or turstable
