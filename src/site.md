## What is this

In recent years a new paradigm around decentralization has emerged.
Technologies such as [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) or [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) offer a new set of possibilities for re-designing most of the systems that drive our society.

**Uumm is a tool for the process of decision making**

For good decisions to be made the right incentives must be in place. One of the goals of this project is to create a tool that makes easy to create such ecosystem.

## Where are we
We have a first working prototype, that you can try already.
On the [Github repo](https://github.com/xavivives/uumm) you can find all the details about it.

We are already working on a second iteration, and we [would love to hear any input you may have](https://github.com/xavivives/uumm/issues).
