#Uummm

_Decentralized meritocracy_

###What is this

In recent years a new paradignm around decentralization has emerged.
Technologies such as Ethereum, IPFS or Bitcoin offer a whole new set of possibilities for re-designing most of the systems that drives our society.

**Uumm is a tool for the process of decision making**

For good decisions to be made the right incentives must be in place. One of the goals of this project is to create a tool that makes easy to create such ecosystem.

###How it works

The logic behind Uumm is ran by the Ethereum Network. Making the process extremely hard to censorship, transparent and accesible to anyone/anything.


### Where are we
We have a first working prototype. It covers a simple use-case where

`Contribution = Voting rights = Earnngs`

We are already working on a second iteration, and we would love to hear any input you may have.
