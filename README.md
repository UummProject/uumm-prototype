# What's thi project about?
It's a decentralized governance tool for collaborative projects based on the assumption that the percentage of ownership of the project is equal to the percentage of user contribution to the project.

The percentage of ownership translates into the percentage of voting rights as well as the percentage of received income in case the project receives funds.

Value contributed % ==  Voting rights % == Recieved funds %

# Status
The current goal is to have an MVP running with no fancy features within a couple of weeks (by 18/07/17) Once the MVP is done and tested we will re-think the direction of the project.

- [x] Initial design and sketches
- [x] Repo and readme setup 
- [ ] Contracts design
- [ ] User interface
- [ ] Ropsten deployment
- [ ] Testing and polishing

# Tech stack
The project runs on top of the Ethereum network.
This contract (//toLink) is the core of the project.
Embark as a framework for Ethereum.
Javascript with ReactJS and Material-UI for the user interface.

I'm using the stack I'm currently familiar with. Thinking on a full refactor if MVP is successful (considering ClojureScript and Truffle)

# Personal motivations
I found myself collaborating in projects that started with an idea and grew organically to a more serious stuff.

Common features of these projects are:
- Lack of authority for ultimate decision making.
- Increase and decrease of the number of participants.
- No clear monetization strategy or total lack of it.
- Interdisciplinary  (Not only software development, harder to track collaborations).

This translates to:
- No record of contributions, therefore no reputation systems, no incentives to keep participating.
- When governance is implemented in the project, earlier contributions are dismissed or not valued 
- Incapacity to distribute monetary gains fairly (open source project receives a donation).

With this project, I'm trying to solve some of these issues, or at least understand them deeply.

I also intend to use it for future projects of mine to incentivise collaboration.

I'm new to the Ethereum development, so, this project is an excuse to dig deep into it. As always any input is welcomed.

# Brainstorming

- Make it ERC20 token compliant?

Got ideas? 
Would you like to try it?
I'm looking for real world use-cases fot test.
